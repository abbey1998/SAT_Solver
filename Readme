This is a basic SAT Solver that used Unit Clauses and Pure Literals to reduce the search space.

The Input is of the following format
First line contains name of the literals seperated by "," (commas)
Second line contains the number of clauses
Then we have all the clauses in individual lines

example input:
x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6
7
x1'
x3
x2+x4'+x6'
x2+x6+x5
x2+x5
x5'+x6'+x4
x5+x4+x6

Note: x' means x_bar or ~x
